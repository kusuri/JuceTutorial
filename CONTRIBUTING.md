# How to contribute 

## Writing new issues

An _issue_ is a fundamental piece of information and work related to the development of a software product.

When _creating_ an issue be sure:
* to include all relevant information: product design aspects, UI resources, technical information on software design and implementation, etc.
* to refer to any related issues
* to use the label system available in each repository.

Don't forget: _creating_ an issue is just the start! Upon creation the issue should contain the minimum amount of information someone needs to start working on it. This way we don't overwhelm ourselves with documenting every single detail. As work progresses, the issue will get bigger through the comments and contain all additional information and decisions. When closed, the issue serves as an **organic** documentation of the work.

When _commenting_ on an issue you are creating a piece of documentation. This means the comment should fit the context of the issue and help the discussion go forward towards a resolution.


## Reporting bugs

Here are some guidelines for effective bug reporting:
- A bug is reported using the `Issue` feature of github.
- Have a *clear* title that describes what's going on. Make sure to include the most **important** words, as it will be easier to perform a search afterwards.
- Assign *all* relevant labels. Any issue that is a bug must have the **bug** label.  Additionally, we have created labels for OS, DAW and plug-in format. It's good to use them, because we can efficiently *filter* issues based on labels and see what's going on.
- Provide *context* and more importantly **steps to reproduce**. A bug may receive a low priority and some months may pass before someone begins work on it. If there are no clear steps on how to reproduce the bug, no one will remember what went on and the issue will be probably ignored.
- Provide some description of the *expected* behaviour and what actually happens. 

[This](http://testobsessed.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/webr.pdf) is a nice article that describes the above more formally.

**Note:** `Assignee` and `Milestone` are fields to be filled out by the team when the issue is assigned to a sprint backlog.
